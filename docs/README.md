# Project Documentation

This folder stores screenshots, diagrams, and supporting documentation for the RSCH650 project.

## Structure

- `docs/images/` → screenshots used in README.md
- `docs/` → any extended documentation, architecture diagrams, and research framing

Keep diagrams lightweight and link back to the main [README.md](../README.md) whenever possible.
